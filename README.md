# Trainee Program

This is our, team 3, website project.

+The website was designed by Thai Tuan. The effect he used is Scrolling Parallax. This is how he have done it:
- Firstly, he searched the vector image on Internet, then put it in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to process it into separated layers. Also he used the logo from Trainee Program.
- Secondly, he wrote the whole necessary HTML/CSS for the website, then wrote a JavaScript to make the Scrolling Parallax effect (detailed files are put in our repository (master branch)).
- Finally, he published them onto "Trainee-Program" repository.


+After discussing about the project and reviewing Tuan's website:
- Tuan and Huynh Tien decided to optimize the website <integer number> times.
- Each member designed his/her own personal information card or use the template from Trainee Program, then each member pushed the card onto repository.
- Tien adjusted the website to perfectly fit 11 personal cards, adding some more effects to it by using HTML/CSS/JS, then pulled and added 11 card into website. (we're using <iframe> to import personal card for convenient mean).
- We published the code onto Trainee-Program.
- The website is done.
